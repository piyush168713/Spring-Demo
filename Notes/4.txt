Special Note about init and destroy Method Signatures

When using XML configuration, I want to provide additional details regarding the method signatures of the init-method  and destroy-method .

Access modifier
The method can have any access modifier (public, protected, private)

Return type
The method can have any return type. However, "void' is most commonly used. If you give a return type just note that you will not be able to capture the return value. As a result, "void" is commonly used.

Method name
The method can have any method name.

Arguments
The method can not accept any arguments. The method should be no-arg.
