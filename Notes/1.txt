Question 1:
Why do we specify the Coach interface in getBean()?

Answer:
Coach theCoach = context.getBean("myTrackCoach", Coach.class);

When we pass the interface to the method, behind the scenes Spring will cast the object for you.

context.getBean("myTrackCoach", Coach.class)

However, there are some slight differences than normal casting.

From the Spring docs:

Behaves the same as getBean(String), but provides a measure of type safety by throwing a BeanNotOfRequiredTypeException
if the bean is not of the required type. This means that ClassCastException can't be thrown on casting the result
correctly, as can happen with getBean(String).
