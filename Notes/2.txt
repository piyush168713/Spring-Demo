Question:
Why do we create no-argument constuctor to TrackCoach class.

Answer:
created a no-argument constructor to TrackCoach
Because
When you don’t define any constructor in your class, compiler defines default one for you,
however when you declare any constructor (in your example you have already defined a parameterized
constructor), compiler doesn’t do it for you.

Since you have defined a constructor in class code, compiler didn’t create default one.
While creating object you are invoking default one, which doesn’t exist in class code.
Then the code gives an compilation error.
